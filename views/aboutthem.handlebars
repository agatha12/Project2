I'm a 31-year-old woman and when I think about what I want to wear, I want a wardrobe,” says Supriya Lele, the British Indian designer who will stage her first solo presentation this week after flying the nest of Fashion East. The wardrobe in question is one full of swathes of drapery, high-low fabric combos and precision tailoring that takes its cue from menswear.

It may be her first presentation, but this is not Lele’s first time at the rodeo. After graduating from Edinburgh College of Art, Lele spent a few years gaining experience in London and New York, working for fashion houses including Nicole Farhi and Roksanda. In 2016, she graduated from the Royal College of Art and was swiftly scouted by Lulu Kennedy and the rest is kismet.

  After graduating from The Art Institute, I returned to Colombia. It was difficult for me to find clothing that appealed to my taste, so I started designing for myself. People would always ask what I was wearing and how I styled it, and eventually friends starting coming to me for advice on how to dress for important events. I thought to myself, why not start my own label?

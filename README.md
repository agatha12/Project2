# Project2

We worked as a team to create a website that showcases and sells clothing by up and coming high fashion designers. 

The site uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Passport, Handlebars and Mysql. We used an orm format to make various calls to our server to Create, Read, Update and Delete data from a remote Mysql database. Passport was used for authentication. 

Users are first directed to a home page where they can choose to go a number of places. They can view a testimonials page where they can add their own testimonial. The About Us page has a desciprtion the three site developers. The Designers page displays photographs and descriptions of some of the designers featured in the shop. 

Users can also choose to shop by either clicking the 'shop now' button or clicking any of the category  buttons in the header. Once on the product view page users can choose to add items to their cart. 

If the user is not logged in they will be redirected to the login page. Once they have logged in and added and item to their cart they can view their cart by click on the shopping cart icon. Currently the checkout button does not have a function since there are no real products to buy. 

There is also a supervisor view which can be accessed by logging in as user 1. As supervisor you can delete, update, and add products. You can also view and delete orders and testimonials.
